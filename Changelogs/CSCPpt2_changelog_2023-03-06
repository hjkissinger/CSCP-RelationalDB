# Changelog for Data Cleaning

Create tables in R (see R-script).

## Manually clean chemical table in excel

Import chemical table into excel
Use conditional formatting on the CasNumber column to highlight ‘Na’ in red.
Look up chemical names’ cas numbers for highlighted Na rows.
Duplicate the first sheet on a new spreadsheet.
Highlight data to change into table for filtering.
Sort ChemicalName in Ascending order.
Identify chemicals with the same name or similar names.
Change ChemicalName to be more specific if cas numbers are different.
Cocamide diethanolamine
966 = amides, coco
967 = Amides, C12-18, N,N-bis(hydroxyethyl)

## Upload tables into Tableau for integrity RDB check

Take screenshot to confirm table connections.

## Upload tables into BigQuery for analysis

Check the data types one last time:
ChemicalDateRemoved from SubCatChemId and VarChemId tables is string. Change to date.
DiscontinuedDate from Product table is a string. Change to date.
Add column with binary for ChemicalDateRemoved from SubCatChemId and VarChemId tables (1/0).
Add column with binary for DiscontinuedDate from Product table
