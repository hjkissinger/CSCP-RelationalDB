# California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) Relational Database Project (2023-03-21) :lipstick: :test_tube:

The goal of this project was to convert the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) spreadsheet into a relational database for downstream analysis.

The project was a three part article series. <a href="https://hjkissinger.info/CSCPpt1/">Part I<a> discusses the creation of business rules and an entity relationship diagram for the CSCP dataset. Part II (coming soon) focuses on building the relational database. Part III (coming soon) discusses key insights and visualizations derived from the CSCP dataset.

The **tools** used for this project were R, Excel, and Tableau. Check out the R Scripts and Google Sheets Changelog to see my process or head to Tableau to see the interactive dashboard!
