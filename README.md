# California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) Relational Database Project (2023-03-21) :lipstick: :test_tube:

The goal of this project was to convert the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) spreadsheet into a relational database for downstream analysis.

The project was a three part article series. <a href="https://hjkissinger.info/CSCPpt1/">Part I<a> discusses the creation of business rules and an entity relationship diagram for the CSCP dataset. <a href="https://hjkissinger.info/CSCPpt2/">Part II</a> focuses on building the relational database. 

The **tools** used for this project were R and Excel. Check out the R Scripts and Google Sheets Changelog to see my process!
